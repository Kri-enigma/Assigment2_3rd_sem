# Assigment2_3rd_sem

Write a program to store a graph using an adjacency matrix given above. Implement the following functions-

1.getNeighbor(n): It prints all the neighbors of node n. For instance, the neighbor of 3 is 2 and 4. The expected time complexity is O(d) where d is the degree of node n.

2.insertEdge(x,y): Insert an edge or connection between node x and y. For instance, insertEdge(1,3) establishes a connection between nodes 1 and 3. The expected time complexity is O(1).

3.deleteEdge(x,y): Delete an edge between x and y. For instance, deleteEdge(3,4) deletes the connection between 3 and 4. The expected time complexity is O(1).

4.isNeighbor(x,y): It returns true if y is neighbor of x. The expected time complexity is O(1).

5.Path(x,y): Determine whether there exist a path from x to y or not. If it exists, print all the nodes in the path.

6.maxDegree(): It returns the maximum connection of a given graph.

7.minDegree(): It returns the minimum connection of a given graph.

8.avgDegree(): It returns the average connection of a given graph.
